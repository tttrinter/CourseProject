Coursera-DataScience -DataGathering Course Project
This repository contains the data files and R scripts for the course project for the Coursera class on Getting and Cleaning Data.

The UCI HAR Dataset folder has all of the data files.  The final answer is in the results.txt file in the same folder and consists of a matrix with the first and second columns as factors for the subjectId and activity respectively.  The following 79 columns represent all of the different measurements that contained std or mean in the name.  The data then represents the average value for each test subject and activity along all of the std and mean measurements.
